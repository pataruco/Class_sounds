# Super Mario Bros Sound Board

My name is Pedro Martin.

Currently (May 2015) I am a student at London General Assembly Web Development Immersive Course.

The second week assignment was to make a sound board page.

My inspiration was my favoutite video game, Super Mario Bros I.

The technologies I used were:

* HTML 5.
* JavaScript.
* jQuery.
* SoundBoard.js.
